# Create a new VM that will utilize your existing Azure Bastion host

This article shows you how to create a new VM that will utilize your existing Bastion host. 
## Prerequisites
-  First you must [create a bastion host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-create-host-portal).
- The virtual network for the Bastion host must have a subnet to hold VMs (this will be in addition to the AzureBastionSubnet required for the Bastion host).

7. On the **Management** tab, set **Boot diagnostics** to **Off**. Accept the other defaults and then select **Review + create**.
8. On the **Review + create** tab, review the settings, correct any validation errors, and then select **Create**.
9. Wait for the virtual machine creation to complete before continuing.
